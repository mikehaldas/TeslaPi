# TeslaPi
TelsaPi is a security alarm project that integrates an outdoor motion sensor with the headlights and horn of a Model 3 Tesla. The project uses a Raspberry Pi, an outdoor PIR motion detector, and the Tesla API. The code is written in the Python programming language and it will work with all Tesla car models. I just happen to have a Model 3 so that is what it was tested with.

  <li>The outputs of the motion sensor are wired to GPIO 16 pin and a ground pin.</li>
  <li>A 12V DC power supply is used to power the motion detector.</li>
  <li>Although not picture, the Raspberry Pi obviously also needs to be connected to a power source.</li>
  <li>The Raspberry Pi must be connected to an Internet connection either via WIFI or the hard wired Ethernet port.</li>
