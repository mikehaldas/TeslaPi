# TeslaPi
TelsaPi is a security alarm project that integrates an outdoor motion sensor with the headlights and horn of a Model 3 Tesla. The project uses a Raspberry Pi, an outdoor PIR motion detector, and the Tesla API. The code is written in the Python programming language and it will work with all Tesla car models. I just happen to have a Model 3 so that is what it was tested with.
